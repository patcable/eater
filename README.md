Takes a Bitesnap JSON food log and makes it into something you could easily share with whoever you need to share it with. Currently only does photos and descriptions, because that's what I use it for.

## Areas for Improvement
* This could almost certainly be a single html file with an embedded JS file, but sometimes you end up using the tools you're familiar with.
* The design is... obviously not my area of expertise. Any help with `foodlog.gohtml` and `style.css` would be appreciated
* I don't need this anymore, so uh... take it and run, I suppose?
